# DQN learning implementation and evaluation

Traditional reinforcement learning approaches donâ€™t
work well when we want to use high-dimensional sensory inputs
like vision. In this paper we present deep reinforcement learning
and attempt to use it to teach an agent how to play a video game
by self play, getting only raw pixel values and score as an input.
Concretely, we explain and test the DQN algorithm on a Atari
Breakout and Pong games. We compare our performance with
results that DeepMind published in a paper that presented the
mentioned algorithm.
